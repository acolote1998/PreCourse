ðŸš€ Exercise 5: Roman to Integer
Problem Description
Roman numerals are used to represent integer values with specific symbols. Your task is to write a function that converts a given Roman numeral into its corresponding integer value.

Roman numerals are read from left to right, but there's a twist:

If a smaller-value symbol appears before a larger-value symbol, it is subtracted.
If a smaller-value symbol appears after a larger-value symbol, it is added.
