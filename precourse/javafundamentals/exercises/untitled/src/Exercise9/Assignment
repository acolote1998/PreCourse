Exercise: Implement a Library System

Create a class structure for a simple library system.

Create a Book class with the following properties:

title (String)
author (String)
ISBN (String)
isCheckedOut (boolean)
A method to mark a book as checked out and another to check it back in.

Create a Library class that contains:

A list of books.
Methods to add a book, remove a book, and list all available books (books that are not checked out).
A method that allows users to check out or return a book by its ISBN.
Create a User class with:

A name property (String).
A list of books they have checked out.
Methods to check out a book and return a book.
Interaction between classes: Ensure that users can only check out a book if it is available (not checked out already).

This will test your ability to manage relationships between objects and use OOP principles such as encapsulation and interactions between classes.

Take it step by step, and focus on one class at a time. Let me know if you'd like guidance on any part!
